This is a Python application for storing user credentials in a vault.

It was created as part of a university assessment and should not be used as it uses an insecure means of encryption on disk and has no user authentication.

This application demonstrates the use of serialization (pickling), class objects, user modules, and basic operating system agnostic programming.
